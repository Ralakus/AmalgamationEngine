# AmalgamationEngine :video_game:
A C++/OpenGL game engine that I work on as a hobby project

## Naming: :blue_book:
* Everything PascalCase
* C++ headers use .hpp
* Macros use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

# To do:
## Short term :arrow_down:
* ~~Extend math library to remove glm as a dependency ( Fix Matrix4x4 and Quaternion Classes )~~
* Split .hpp files into .hpp and .inl files to clean up code
* Turn Level/Entity/Component System into an ECS
* Add PBR
* Make a better rendering system

## Long term :arrow_forward:
* Make Editor / tools for engine
