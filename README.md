# AmalgamationEngine :video_game:
A C++/OpenGL game engine that I work on as a hobby project
that is meant to be mostly header only

## Naming: :blue_book:
* Namespaces, variables, and functions use snek_case
* Types use UpperCammelCase
* Constants use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
* C++ headers use .hpp
* .inl files are prefered over .cpp files
* All private members in a class have to be near the top of the class definition and prefixed with `_`

# To do:
## Short term :arrow_down:
* Get basic framework setup
* Get renderer setup

## Long term :arrow_forward:
* Make Editor / tools for engine
* Rebuild old engine from scratch with Vulkan
