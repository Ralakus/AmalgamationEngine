# AmalgamationEngine
A C++/OpenGL game engine that I work on as a hobby project

# Naming:
* Everything PascalCase
* C++ headers use .hpp
* Macros use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

# To do:
## Short term :arrow_down:
* Extend math library to remove glm as a dependency
* Split .hpp files into .hpp and .inl files to clean up code
* Add PBR
* Make a better rendering system

## Long term :arrow_forward:
* Make Editor / tools for engine
