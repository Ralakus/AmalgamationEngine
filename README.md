# AmalgamationEngine :video_game:
A C++/OpenGL game engine that I work on as a hobby project
that is meant to be mostly header only

## Naming: :blue_book:
* Everything PascalCase
* Macros use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
* C++ headers use .hpp
* Do not use .cpp files, use .inl in place

# To do:
## Short term :arrow_down:
* Create Premake project :heavy_check_mark:
* Create Core Library
* Be able to render a mesh using Vulkan

## Long term :arrow_forward:
* Make Editor / tools for engine
* Rebuild old engine from scratch with Vulkan
